Here are a few notes to get you started:

* Don't touch the __init__.py files. These are necessary to your project.

* Things will be easier if you read the spec first and follow the given function order.

* Make sure you have ```pip``` installed so you can download pysynth.

* Remember to update this file to describe your finished Final Project.

Good luck on the project!
